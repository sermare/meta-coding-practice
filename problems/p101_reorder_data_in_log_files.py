DESCRIPTION = """Reorder Data in Log Files

You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words,
where the first word is the identifier.

There are two types of logs:
- Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
- Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

Reorder these logs so that:
1. The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
2. The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents
   are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
3. The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.

Example:
    Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
    Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]

Constraints:
- 1 <= logs.length <= 100
- 3 <= logs[i].length <= 100
- All the tokens of logs[i] are separated by a single space.
- logs[i] is guaranteed to have an identifier and at least one word after the identifier.
