DESCRIPTION = """Car Fleet

There are n cars going to the same destination along a one-lane road. The destination
is target miles away.

You are given two integer arrays position and speed, both of length n, where
position[i] is the position of the i-th car and speed[i] is the speed of the i-th car
(in miles per hour).

A car can never pass another car ahead of it, but it can catch up to it and drive bumper
to bumper at the same speed. The faster car will slow down to match the slower car's speed.

A car fleet is some non-empty set of cars driving at the same position and same speed.
A single car is also a car fleet.

If a car catches up to a car fleet right at the destination point, it will still be
considered as one car fleet.

Return the number of car fleets that will arrive at the destination.

Example:
    Input: target = 12, position = [10,8,0,5,3], speed = [2,4,1,1,3]
    Output: 3

Constraints:
- n == position.length == speed.length
- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- 0 < target <= 10^6
- 0 <= position[i] < target
- 0 < speed[i] <= 10^6
