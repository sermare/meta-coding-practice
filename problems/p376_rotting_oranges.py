DESCRIPTION = """
Rotting Oranges

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
- 0 representing an empty cell,
- 1 representing a fresh orange, or
- 2 representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten
orange becomes rotten. Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse
until no cell has a fresh orange. If impossible, return -1.

Constraints:
- m == grid.length
- n == grid[i].length
- 1 <= m, n <= 10
- grid[i][j] is 0, 1, or 2.

Examples:
  Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
  Output: 4

  Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[0,1,1],[1,0,1]]
  Output: -1

  Input: grid = [[0,2]]
  Output: 0
