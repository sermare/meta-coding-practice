DESCRIPTION = """Walls and Gates

You are given an m x n grid `rooms` initialized with these three possible values:
  - -1: A wall or an obstacle.
  - 0: A gate.
  - INF (2147483647): An empty room.

Fill each empty room with the distance to its nearest gate. If it is impossible to
reach a gate, leave the room as INF.

Example:
    Input: rooms = [
        [2147483647,-1,0,2147483647],
        [2147483647,2147483647,2147483647,-1],
        [2147483647,-1,2147483647,-1],
        [0,-1,2147483647,2147483647]
    ]
    Output: [
        [3,-1,0,1],
        [2,2,1,-1],
        [1,-1,2,-1],
        [0,-1,3,4]
    ]
