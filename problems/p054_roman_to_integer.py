DESCRIPTION = """Roman to Integer

Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D and M.

    Symbol       Value
    I             1
    V             5
    X             10
    L             50
    C             100
    D             500
    M             1000

For example, 2 is written as II, 12 is written as XII, 27 is written as XXVII.

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However,
the numeral for four is IV (not IIII). The six instances where subtraction is used:
    - I before V (4) and X (9)
    - X before L (40) and C (90)
    - C before D (400) and M (900)

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

Example 1:
    Input: s = "III"
    Output: 3

Example 2:
    Input: s = "LVIII"
    Output: 58
    Explanation: L = 50, V = 5, III = 3.

Example 3:
    Input: s = "MCMXCIV"
    Output: 1994
    Explanation: M = 1000, CM = 900, XC = 90 and IV = 4.

Constraints:
    - 1 <= s.length <= 15
    - s contains only the characters ('I', 'V', 'X', 'L', 'C', 'D', 'M').
    - It is guaranteed that s is a valid roman numeral in the range [1, 3999].
