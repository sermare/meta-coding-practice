Problem 13: Group Anagrams

Given an array of strings strs, group the anagrams together. You can return
the answer in any order.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different
word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

Constraints:
- 1 <= strs.length <= 10^4
- 0 <= strs[i].length <= 100
- strs[i] consists of lowercase English letters.

Examples:
  Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
  Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]

  Input: strs = [""]
  Output: [[""]]

  Input: strs = ["a"]
  Output: [["a"]]
