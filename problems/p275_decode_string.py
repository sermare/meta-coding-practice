DESCRIPTION = """Decode String

Given an encoded string, return its decoded string.

The encoding rule is: k[encoded_string], where the encoded_string inside the
square brackets is being repeated exactly k times. Note that k is guaranteed to
be a positive integer.

You may assume that the input string is always valid; there are no extra white
spaces, square brackets are well-formed, etc.

Furthermore, you may assume that the original data does not contain any digits and
that digits are only for those repeat numbers, k.

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 30
- s consists of lowercase English letters, digits, and square brackets '[]'
- 1 <= k <= 300

Example:
    Input: s = "3[a]2[bc]"
    Output: "aaabcbc"

    Input: s = "3[a2[c]]"
    Output: "accaccacc"

    return None
